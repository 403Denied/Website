    <p> I am a developer, I have made multiple website pages and I am moshing them together here.<nl> There is a stopwatch, a counter that can save your progress, and a functional weather app,<nl> you input your location and an API shows your weather info. This website can be a bit over the place<nl> but I changed all the color themes to match each other. This includes all custom CSS, HTML, and JS files. The source code is available below by pressing the github icon at the bottom. 
        I just kind of made these all for fun at one point because I got bored. I just made these for fun to entertain me, auto clicking the counter and seeing how high I can get.  I can go AFK and see how long my stopwatch will go for without me noticing it. I can also just check the weather in random locations whenever I want by opening up my local server and running my site. To get to other pages click the buttons on the nav bar.
